            <p class="about-para">This salt cellar is made of ivory and represents Europeans, shown with long hair, beards and hooked noses. It was made by a master craftsperson in the Kingdom of Benin, Nigeria between 1525 – 1600. Africans along the continent's west coast first encountered Portuguese traders in the mid-15th century. This marked the beginning of regular contact and trade, during which the purchase and commissioning of carved ivory goods by Europeans became common.</p>
